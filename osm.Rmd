Open Street Map: loading, analysing and visualising free maps with R and QGIS
========================================================

This tutorial shows how open source tools can be used to 
harness a huge and rapidly growing open source geodatabase: Open Street Map.
It is targeted at people new to Open Street Map, but who 
already have an understanding of basic GIS concepts.
Previous experience with the programs QGIS and R would be beneficial, 
but not essential, for completing the exercises. There are 
also a number of resources available on-line for more advanced functions, 
as described below.

# Introduction

Open Street Map (OSM) is a crowd-sourced map of the world, 
the archetype of 'volunteered geographical information'
([Goodchild 2007](http://www.ncgia.ucsb.edu/projects/vgi/docs/position/Goodchild_VGI2007.pdf)).
The aim is simple: "to create a set of map data thatâ€™s free
to use, editable, and licensed under new
copyright schemes", as described in an excellent review 
article on the subject 
([Haklay and Weber 2008](http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/13849/1/13849.pdf)).
Putting the public in charge of 
editing the world's surface may seem like a risky 
business, given that cartographers have specialist skills 
developed over centuries. This issue is described in 
[Mapping the Void](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/15008199/egs2stay/Mapping_the_Void_-_Mapping_the_Void_b03s6mf0_default.m4a), an excellent BBC Radio 4 Documentary
on the subject (Salisbury and Jenkins 2014). 
Yet the emergence 
of high resolution aerial photography covering the entirety 
of the Earth's surface and the 
explosion in GPS ownership via smartphones has enabled citizens 
to become accurate sensors of the world. 
[Neis et al. (2012)](http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/4/1/1/pdf)
believe this phenomenon is more than merely technological.
In OSM, they see a "revolutionary paradigm shift on how map data is 
being collected".
Citizen mappers have the added advantage that they may know their local 
area far better than any professional cartographer. 

This tutorial adds a small nugget of information to the growing literature
on OSM, by demonstrating how the data can be accessed for teaching or research 
materials. It's a completely free and open dataset, so we may as well use it!
There is already some good on-line material about OSM data, including:

- a [paper](http://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/5/2/282/pdf) comparing the quality and 
coverage of OSM map data in different parts of the world (Neis et al. 2013)
- an [overview](http://www.library.carleton.ca/sites/default/files/help/gis/WorkingWithOpenStreetMap.pdf)
of handling OSM data in ArcMap
- a [tutorial](http://elogeo.nottingham.ac.uk/xmlui/bitstream/handle/url/289/osm-tutorial-final-2.pdf?sequence=1) illustrating 
its potential use for GIS education and store location planning (Lovelace 2013).

Yet nothing has focused on simply loading the data using different tools.
In this paper we use QGIS and R because these are (arguably) the most popular 
open source programs used by geographers, the discipline with most to gain 
from OSM data. Before delving into the method (which is actually quite straightforward), 
let's put OSM data in context.

## Why (and why not) use OSM data?

Of course there are teething issues with any large-scale open source 
database, including variable data quality, 
patchy and incomplete coverage and inconsistencies from place to place (Haklay 2010). Yet all of these
issues are gradually  being ironed out. 
The advantages of Open Street Map outweigh these downsides for
many applications *already*. These include:

- Rapid updates of new projects
- Greater range of attributes (e.g. shop names)
- Ability to share data with anyone without breaching license

In additions there are a number of ethical benefits of using OSM: it's community
a map for the greater good ([Wroclawski 2014](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/14/why-the-world-needs-openstreetmap)). 

There is a strong community of OSM volunteers who use the service for humanitarian purposes
(Salisbury and Jenkins 2014).
Two excellent examples of this help underline the
ethical side of OSM data. [Tindale](http://explore.ramanitanzania.org/), 
a settlement in Tanzania that has been mapped rapidly 
thanks to a single academic project, in collaboration with the authorities, enabling 
better policy making in the area (see [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqrGyvNnWkA)). 
Second, 
the rapid response of the OSM community to the Typhoon Haiyan disaster. In a matter of days, an 
army of volunteers had helped to map out the affected zone, aiding relief efforts (e.g. see
[MapBox's blog posts on the subject](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/typhoon-haiyan-openstreetmap/)).

## An overview of the tutorial

All of the code and data used to create this tutorial is available 
on [GitHub](http://github.com). Feel free to download the project as a `.zip` file from the 
[project's repository](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/osm-tutorial) entitled osm-tutorial from 
github.com/Robinlovelace. This zip file contains all of the code and data 
used to generate the tutorial, which is entirely reproducible. If you would like to modify or improve it 
in any way, please fork a version for you own use, citing the original where appropriate.

The focus is mainly on the technical challenge of extracting the 
data from servers 'in the cloud' and onto your desktop. We also cover some basic 
tasks in handling, subsetting and visualising the data, first in the 
graphical user interface (GUI) of QGIS, and then in the command line with R.
The next stage talks about editing raw OSM data, essential if you 
would like to take subsets of very large OSM datasets, such as `planet.osm` 
which takes up more than 30 GB of memory. The next stage is 
to talk about OSM data in PostGIS, a geodatabase program ideal 
for querying very large spatial datasets. Finally, there is a brief 
section on further resources. None of the sections require any of the 
previous ones although the level of difficulty generally increases 
as you progress. 

# Getting the data

OSM data of a specific area
can be downloaded directly from the [main map page](http://www.openstreetmap.org), from the 
[Overpass API](http://overpass-api.de/) or, for the entire planet, from the huge (currently 32 GB)
[planet.osm file](http://planet.openstreetmap.org/). A number of third parties also provide more manageable
chunks of this dataset, such as the single country datasets provided by
[GEOFABIK](http://download.geofabrik.de/). Command line programs 
[Osmosis](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis) and 
[Osm2pgsl](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql) can be used to process raw OSM data 
in either `.osm` or `.osm.pbf` file formats. The former is essentially a `.xml` (Extensible Markup Language)
text file (encoded with the popular UTF-8 characterset); the latter is a compressed version of the former.
How we transfer these datasets into a useful form depends on the program you are using. 
In this tutorial we will explain how to do it in QGIS and R, as well describing the basics of 
getting it into a [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/) database.

# OSM data in QGIS

A `.osm` file can be downloaded from the openstreetmap.org with the bounding box selected by
default depending on the current view, or via a manual selection, as shown below.

```{r Manual selection of bounding box, fig.width=12, fig.height=8, echo=FALSE}
library(png)
library(grid)
img <- readPNG("osmfigs/manual-selection.png")
 grid.raster(img)
```

To load this file into QGIS, you can simply use the `Add Vector Layer` button on the 
left of the screen. However this does not generate satisfactory results. 
The *recommended* way to import the data is via the the OSM plugin. When this is 
installed in QGIS 2.0, use the menus `Vector > OpenStreetMap` to import the xml file
and convert it into a SpatiaLite database. Then you can import it into the QGIS workspace. 

![Import the osm data to SpatiaLite](osmfigs/import-osm.png)

After this step the file has been saved as a `.osm.db` file. Use the 
`Export Topology to SpatiaLite` element of the same menu to 
load the file. Choose the type of spatial data you would like to load - 
Points, Lines or Polygons. At this stage one can also select which variables 
("Tags") you would like to add to the attribute data.

![Select Polylines](osmfigs/open-osmdb.png)

The data is now loaded into QGIS allowing standard methods of analysis. 
You will notice that the data are not styled at all, leading to very bland 
maps. To counter this, there have been custom styles developed for visualising OSM data in QGIS, 
e.g. [those by Anita Grazer](http://anitagraser.com/2012/02/25/light-styles-for-osm-layers-in-qgis/). 
Unfortunately these files do not seem to be working with the current version of QGIS so 
alternative ready-made styles must be created, as suggested by a 
[stackexchange question](http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/42645/is-there-up-to-date-osm-sld-file-for-geoserver). 

Once the data is loaded into QGIS, it can be used as with any other spatial data.
Next, let's see how R can handle OSM data, via the `osmar` package.

# Using osmar 

`osmar` is an R package for downloading and interrogating OSM data that accesses 
the data directly from the internet via the R command line.
There is an excellent
[online tutorial](http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2013-1/eugster-schlesinger.pdf)
which provides a detailed account of the package (Eugster & Schlesinger, 2012). 
Here we will focus on loading some basic data on bicycle paths in Leeds.
First the package must be loaded:

```{r, results='hide'}
library(osmar) # if the package is not already installed, use install.packages("osmar")
```

To download data directly, one first sets the source and a bounding box, 
and then use the `get_osm` function to download it. Selecting Chapeltown as the 
centrepoint of the map, we can download all the data in the square km surrounding it.

```{r, Preliminary plot of Chapletown with osmar}
src <- osmsource_api()
bb <- center_bbox(-1.53492, 53.81934, 1000, 1000)
ctown <- get_osm(bb, source = src)
plot(ctown)
points(-1.53492, 53.81934, col="red", lwd = 5)
```

This shows that the data has successfully been loaded and saved as an 
object called `ctown`. Let's try analysing this object further. 
In fact, `ctown` is technically a list, composed of 3 objects:
nodes (points), ways (lines) and relations (polygons composed of 
many lines). Such OSM data is thus provided a class of its own, 
and each sub-object can be called separately using the `$` symbol:

```{r}
names(ctown)
class(ctown)
summary(ctown$ways)
```

Let's use the dataset we have loaded to investigate the cycle 
paths in the vicinity of my house. First we need to understand the data
contained in the object. Let's look at the tags and the attributes of the `ways` object:

```{r}
summary(ctown$ways$tags) # summary of the tag data
ctown$ways$attrs[1:8, 1:6] # attributes of first 8 ways - see I'm in there!
```

From looking at the [OSM tagging system](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tags), we can deduce that 
`id` is the element's id,
`k` refers to the OSM key (the variables for which the element 
has values) and that `v` is the value assigned for each 
id - key combination. Because OSM data is not a simple data frame, 
we cannot use the usual R notation for subsetting. Instead we use the 
`find` function. Let us take a subset of bicycle paths in the area
and plot them.

```{r Bike paths of Chapeltown}
bikePaths <- find(ctown, way(tags(k == "bicycle" & v == "yes" )) )
bikePaths <- find_down(ctown, way(bikePaths))
bikePaths <- subset(ctown, ids= bikePaths)
plot(ctown)
plot_ways(bikePaths, add = T, col = "red", lwd = 3)
```

The above code block is used to identify all ways in which cycling 
is permitted, "overriding default access", according OSM's excellent 
[wiki page on bicycle paths](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bicycle).

According to this source, the correct way to refer to an on-road cycle path 
is with the `cycleway` tag. However, none of these have been added to the
roads that have on-road cycle lanes in this example dataset (as of January 2014).
Perhaps someone will add these soon. 

```{r}
which(ctown$ways$tags$k == "cycleway")
```

There are, by contrast, a large number of ways classified as "residential".
Let us use the same method to select them and add them to the map.

```{r Residential streets in Chapeltown}
res <- find(ctown, way(tags(k == "highway" & v == "residential" )) )
res <- find_down(ctown, way(res))
res <- subset(ctown, ids= res)
plot(ctown)
plot_ways(res, add = T, col = "green", lwd = 3)
```

# Handling raw OSM data

Although this section will be of most use for dealing with 
very large files, a small example is used here to showcase the methods
The file `map.osm` downloaded directly from [openstreetmap.org](http://www.openstreetmap.org)
is small, allowing available on-line, from 
[here](https://github.com/Robinlovelace/osm-tutorial/blob/master/data/map.osm?raw=true) 
(highlighting the advantages 
of open data for educational purposes - there are few license restrictions).

The Java command line tool [Osmosis](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis)
is used for this purpose.

To show how Osmosis can subset raw OSM files, let us take a real world example from 
the dataset we imported with the `osmar` package. Imagine that we want to extract all 
osm data (nodes, ways and relations) from the area in and around Potternewton Park.
We could do this manually by looking up the park on-line and selecting the associated
elements in QGIS. But imagine we want to do it from the 
command line (e.g. for batch processing).
First we need a bounding box of all items containing the 
text string "Potternewton Park". For this we use `osmar`:

```{r, Line data of Potternewton park}
potter <- find(ctown, way(tags(grepl("Potternewton Park", ctown$ways$tags$v))))
potter <- find_down(ctown, way(potter))
potter <- subset(ctown, ids = potter)
plot_ways(potter) # sanity check
potter.l <- as_sp(potter, "lines") # convert data to sp class
b <- bbox(potter.l) # save the bounding box
b[1, ] <- (b[1, ] - mean(b[1, ])) * 1.05 + mean(b[1, ])
b[2, ] <- (b[2, ] - mean(b[2, ])) * 1.05 + mean(b[2, ])
# scale longitude and latitude (increase bb by 5% for plot) replace 1.05
# with 1.xx for an xx% increase in the plot size
b
```

Now that we know the bounding box, we can transfer to using osmosis from 
the command line. If the shell is open in the correct working directory
(e.g. "osm-tutorial-master", if downloaded from GitHub), the following 
code will subset the data and output a new, smaller `.osm` file.

```
osmosis --read-xml data/map.osm --bounding-box top=53.822093 left=-1.528815
   bottom=53.817486 right=-1.521155 --write-xml potter.osm

```

To check whether or not this has worked, and demonstrate `osmar`'s ability to read in 
`.osm` files, let us try to load an plot the dataset just exported by osmosis.

```{r All OSM data in and directly surround Potternewton Park, warning=FALSE}
src <- osmsource_osmosis(file="data/potter.osm")
bp <- center_bbox(mean(b[1, ]), mean(b[2, ]), 1000, 1000)
potter <- get_osm(bp, src)
plot(potter)
```

Local knowledge or a quick look on an online will confirm that this is 
indeed Potternewton Park, with is rectangular tennis courts, play area 
and skate park just west of its centre. The file `potter.osm` can 
equally be loaded into QGIS or any other GIS. The point is to illustrate
how Osmosis works. 

For further functionality, including clipping to polygons, extracting files from 
enormous and compressed `planet.osm.bz2` files and ways to extract only elements with 
certain attributes, please refer to the 
[osmosis page of the osm wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis). 
The final section discusses (but does not implement)
the most advanced method of harnessing OSM data, via a PostGIS database. 

# Creating a PostGIS database of OSM data

There are a number of advantages of storing large datasets 
in a database:

- The data can be accessed by a variety of 3rd party programs
- Spatial queries can be made by a variety of clients accessing the db, widening the functionality
- Huge datasets can be stored in a database, as it sits on the hard disk, only being 
transferred to RAM when a specific query is called

Because of the size and complexity of the planet-wide OSM database, it must 
be stored in an spatial database to be used. For this use the command line tool 
[osm2pgsql](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql). The basics of installation 
and usage can be found online. 

Using a spatial database, it does not take a very large leap to realise that 
organisations can create a customised version of the OSM database for their own purposes.
For example, an organisation interested in store location analysis could keep maintained 
a version of OSM with everything with elements labelled as shops removed. Alternatively, 
an organisation interested in woodlands could maintain an up-to-date version 
of OSM woodlands. Both organisations could supplement these custom databases with their
own data, combining the best of crowd-sourced and centralised data collection methods.

The [OSM-GB](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osm2pgsql) project, hosted at the University
of Nottingham does precisely this, with the aim of quality-checking community contributed data.
Here is not the place to describe how to set-up a PostGIS database with OSM data, but is well 
worth flagging as it has great potential, especially when combined with rapidly 
evolving open source web mapping technologies such as 
[GeoServer](http://geoserver.org/display/GEOS/Welcome)
(part of the 
[GeoNode](http://geonode.org/) stack), [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) and 
[GeoDjango](https://www.djangoproject.com/). 

# Conclusion

With the certainty of peak oil and possibility of 
effective climate change regulations, transport will become increasing 
expensive in future years. Thus, the tendency towards geographical 
homogenisation of economic activity may go into reverse 
([Greer 2009](http://books.google.co.uk/books?hl=en&lr=&id=mkV_knlze0QC&oi=fnd&pg=PP2&dq=ecotechnic+future&ots=nATRuCVL31&sig=bwafIZ7kfmZMK1EscQcKyIGeYsU&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=ecotechnic%20future&f=false); 
[Curtis  2009](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800909003334)). 
This is bad news for many, but it is good news for people with 
a strong interest in regional diversity, local economies and geographic diversity. 

It is also potentially good news for geographers advocating for location-specific 
solutions. With increased concern over the 
highly centralised power structures of the internet following the 
revelations leaked by Edward Snowdon about massive online spying 
and infringement of digital privacy, there 
is a huge potential for community-based, problem-specific solutions.
It is with this wider context in mind that this tutorial ends - 
think of the potential benefits if citizens were encouraged to be
both producers and consumers of the maps on which we all now depend.
Happy mapping!
