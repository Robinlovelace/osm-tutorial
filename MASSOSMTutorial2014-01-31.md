## 4. Notes

### 4.1. The changing nature of OSM
* OpenStreetMap (OSM) has grown in popularity and is now mainstream
* It is no longer just about ways, it is an Open Map for many things
   * Buildings
   * Points of interest
   * Names
* Incorporating open data on public transport stops and timetables
* To contribute to OSM originally one needed GPS, but now there are other ways to contribute
* National mapping agencies now using and contributing to OpenStreetMap

### 4.2. OSM for disaster response and mapping voids
* Crisis Mappers
   * http://crisismappers.net/
* Baghdad
   * http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Baghdad
* Map Kibera
   * http://mapkibera.org/
* Started in 2009 when there was no map
   * Spawned a Citizen News Channel
   * Haiti
   * http://hot.openstreetmap.org/projects/haiti-2
   * http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Haiti/Earthquake_map_resources
* Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team

* Red Cross

* Visualising information from email, text messages and blog posts

### 4.3. OSM utility for education
* Students get to see their contribution to something that is preserved for the long term
   * This is empowering
* Tandale Tanzania

### 4.4. Complimentary Open Mapping
* Wikimapia
   * http://wikimapia.org/
* Wikipedia
   * http://www.wikipedia.org/
* Ushahidi
   * http://www.ushahidi.com/

### 4.5. Exercises with OSM
* Looking at changes over time
* Exploring data formats and conversion
   * .osm is an XML format
   * .pbf .gzip are compressed versions
* Practice handling large data sizes
* Creating subsets of the data and releasing/serving it
* Testing the routemap factor
   * Euclidean distance / road distance
   * The closer this is to 1 for the average journey in an area, the more developed the areas transport infrastructure is
   * Knowing the variation in this measure can be useful…
* Find something to add to the map on campus or from the local area

### 4.6. OSM Frameworks Tools and Services
* http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Frameworks
* OSMOSIS
   * http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis
   * Java application for processing OSM data
* Travelling Salesman
   * http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Traveling_salesman
   * Java application for routing based on OSM data
* Nominatim
   * http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nominatim 
   * Tool to search OSM data by name and address and to generate synthetic addresses of OSM points (reverse geocoding)
* Cloudmade

   * OSM data packager and re-distributer
* Stamen

### 4.7. Future
* Will OSM ever be able to compete with the likes of Google for providing detail about real time live traffic?
* Protecting people that do the mapping/provide information
* Some people don’t want things mapping and are prepared to kill!
